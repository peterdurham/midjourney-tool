export const scriptPrompt = `Please help me create a short-form video script (30–60 seconds). The goal of this video is to deliver a powerful, insight-rich exploration of a mythic or symbolic theme that most people think they understand—but don’t.

The script must do four things well:

Hook hard in the first line—open with a compelling, bold, or surprising idea that grabs attention immediately

Reveal the deeper meaning of the theme, myth, or archetype—not just what happens, but why it matters with successive insights.

Drop in relevant lesser-known facts or details—ancient origins, planetary links, comparitive mythology, mythic contradictions, symbolic patterns, etc.—anything that adds real value. Don't include any details that are not relevant to the theme.

End with an insight that hits emotionally or intellectually, leaving the viewer with a sense of mythic memory, psychological truth, or overarching relevance

Please shape this into a YouTube Short/TikTok/Reels pacing structure with suggested cut points. Don't give any visual cues, ill handle that.

Tone & Style:
– Mythic but not flowery. Grounded, clear, evocative
– Poetic where needed, but always in service of meaning
– Direct, tightly written, and paced for a short-form audience
– No fluff—every sentence should teach, reveal, or provoke
- Quick hitting and evocative of mythic imagery, symbols, and archetypes

Purpose:
– To reawaken myth as something living and relevant
– To help people see the stories they’ve forgotten how to see
– To create a moment of resonance—where history, archetype, and the human psyche intersect
– To offer knowledge, but also transformation

Format:
– Spoken-word script (voiceover or face-camera)
– Ideal for Instagram Reels, TikTok, or YouTube Shorts (30–60 seconds)

Here is the video topic: `;
